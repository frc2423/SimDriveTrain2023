Hi!
There are two end conditions of the simulation project.
One is to have the robot follow a trajectory in autonomous mode.
The second is to have the robot drive at either a constant speed, keyboard or using a controller.

Robot.java and Drivetrain.java both have several comments with a TODO in it.
Your mission is fill in the TODO, testing as needed.
Nothing should change in Main.java
